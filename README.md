# Lexicon – HTML & CSS Recipe (Updated Version)

This project is an updated version of the original HTML/CSS assignment from Lexicon.  
The goal was to rebuild the simple recipe page using semantic HTML5, improved accessibility, and more modern best practices.

## 🔧 Improvements in the Updated Version
- Reworked HTML structure for better semantic hierarchy (sections, article, headings)  
- Improved accessibility (WCAG-friendly alt texts, ARIA labels, consistent heading order)  
- Converted all images from JPG to WebP for improved performance  
- Reduced image file sizes and optimized loading  
- Updated layout structure in the last section (experimented with `figure` instead of `div`)  
- Cleaned up CSS and improved class naming  
- General refactoring for readability and future maintainability  

## 📁 Project Contents
- `index.html` – main HTML file  
- `style.css` – styling file  
- `/bilder` – optimized images in WebP format  

## 🎓 Purpose
This project was part of an early HTML/CSS learning module and has been revisited later to apply improved skills in:  
- Semantic HTML  
- Accessibility (WCAG)  
- Image optimization  
- Basic performance improvements  
- Clean project structuring
